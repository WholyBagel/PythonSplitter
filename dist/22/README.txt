Welcome to the new and improved way of splitting documents!
This folder is used for HELOC's with three extra documents.
After the auto split, you have to manually name the three docs.
It will be called 'number of HELOC'-1 and -2 and -3

Double click on 22PageSplitter to auto split all HELOC's
in this folder.

The HELOC must fit the exact order as below
