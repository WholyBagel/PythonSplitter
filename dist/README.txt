Welcome to the new and improved way of splitting documents!

Double click on splitter.exe to 'manually' split the pdf
First, type the name of the document
Second, type the first page for the split (starting from 0)
Third, type the last page after the split
Click enter and repeat 

Once done splitting current document enter a 
single number or letter and click enter

After splitting all documents, 
the splits will be stored in Temp



The document's pages are stored from 0 - #

So if a document is 19 Pages long the first page is 0
If you want the first 6 pages the command would be 'name' 0 6
This would get you pages 0-5 stopping on page 6
