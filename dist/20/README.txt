Welcome to the new and improved way of splitting documents!
This folder is used for HELOC's with one extra document.
After the auto split, you have to manually name the document.
It will be called 'number of HELOC'-1

Double click on 20PageSplitter to auto split all HELOC's
in this folder.

The HELOC must fit the exact order as below
